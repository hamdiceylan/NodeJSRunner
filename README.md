NodeJSRunner
============

NodeJSRunner is an application that starts Node.js server automatically and opens web browser window to display the server.

You just need to browse for a .js file and use it.NodeJSRunner will do the rest.

One thing about the js file; NodeJSRunner reads line by line.Thats why you need to write js like that.


This application was built with C# and needs .Net Framework 4.5 to use.
